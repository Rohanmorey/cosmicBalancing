Understanding the L1 Lagrange Point mathematically involves some concepts from celestial mechanics and gravitational physics.
Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation: This is the foundation of understanding gravitational forces. It states that every mass attracts every other mass with a force that is directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. Mathematically, it's expressed as:
> ** F = G * (m1 * m2) / r^2 **
